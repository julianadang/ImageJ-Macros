//ImageJ-Macros
//Macros written to automate image processing tasks
//You have a bunch of multichannel images but the contrast on channel two is weak so you want to
//enhance it to make crisp images for your presentation slides? Saturation level 80% works well but
//try it out for yourself. Note: This macro works on image batches and saves the edited images in
//a whichever folder you want with the same file name

function enhancecontrast(input, output, filename) {
	 open(input + filename);
	 filename = getTitle();
	 setSlice(2);
	 run("Enhance Contrast", "saturated=0.80");
	 save(output + filename);
	 close();
}
